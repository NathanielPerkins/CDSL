# ECDSL - Embedded C Data Structures Libraries
Light weight, low memory implementations of common programming data structures and algorithms found in higher level languages like C++, python and Java.

This repository uses Git-flow, an example of which can be seen  https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow

To Be Implemented 
Data Structures:
Doubly Linked List
